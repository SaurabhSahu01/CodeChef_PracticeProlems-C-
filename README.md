# CodeChef_PracticeProlems-C-
Hey there! 
This repo was supposed to be personal, but then I realised why should I keep my mistakes to myself only. Let others also learn from it.
So here I will be uploading all the approaches to tackle a given problem and the difficulties I faced while solving them.

This Repo is open for contribution. 
You can upload your solution in the format described below : 
<program name>_<your name>.cpp 
  for example : NAME1_SaurabhSahu.cpp
